Implemented a functionality for the number of jobs that match a particular skill. The previous iteration of the project only displayed the skills for which jobs were found. The functionality works as follows : Every job tag on job searching website has a particular name in the HTML code (in the div class), which is used in the scrapper files in order to search for similar jobs. We have performed web scraping of jobs on three different websites, including LinkedIn, Glassdoor and Indeed.
